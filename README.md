```bash
git clone git@github.com:vietnguyenhoangw/hacker-news.git
cd hacker-news

npm run dev (with npm)
# or

```

## 🔨 Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android app:

npm run android
# or
yarn android
```

## 🎉 Congratulations!
